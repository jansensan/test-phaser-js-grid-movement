# PhaserJS Grid Movement

## About

An attempt at implementing [PhaserJS's Coding Tip #5](http://www.photonstorm.com/phaser/phaser-coding-tips-5).

For some reason, Phaser's Arcade Physics engine didn't handle collision detection. In its stead, I implemented my own tile-based collision system and movement.

## TODO

- Test NPCs moving independently
- Test A* algorithm on clicking a valid tile
